# How to use initial viewing space
[![](../../screenshots/other/Go-back.png)](README.md)

Initial viewing space allows you to choose the part of the dashboard you want to work on.

For this demonstration 11, we will take the result of the [tutorial9](tutorial9.md)

![tutorial9](../../screenshots/demo/tutorial09/result.png)

And we will modify the `initial viewing space` to work only on the upper right part of the dashboard

To do that :
 - Change xMin from -100 to 0
 - Change Ymin from -100 to 0

![result](../../screenshots/demo/tutorial11/initial.png)

Then, you will see that the initial space will move and you will be able to work only on the upper right part of the dashboard.
