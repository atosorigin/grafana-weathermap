# How to change initial viewing space

[![](../../screenshots/other/Go-back.png)](README.md)

Initial viewing space allows you to choose the part of the dashboard you want to work on.

For this demonstration 11, we will take the result of the [tutorial 09](tutorial09.md)

![tutorial9](../../screenshots/demo/tutorial09/result.png)

We modify the graduation of the rendering. For that, we modify `initial viewing space` with the new values.

The representation is recalculated with the new limitations. The objects will be automatically recalculated to get new values like this :


`Region 1`

`Region 2`

`Region 3`

the new result will be
