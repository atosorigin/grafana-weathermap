This section allows you to resize your workspace. The cutout is as shown below.

The X and Y axes range from -100% to 100%. 

For example:
If you want to work on the upper part of the image the characteristics will be as follows
- X min: -100
- X max: 100
- Y min : 0
- Y max : 100

The part in red will, therefore, be editable.
