# Initial viewing space

[![](../../screenshots/other/Go-back.png)](README.md)

This section allows you to resize your workspace.

## Pre-Requests

You must have defined a background space in the [Display](display.md) tab as the initial viewing space.

## Viewving space

![display](../../screenshots/editor/initial/initial-space-border.jpg)

The `Display space initial` line is useful if you do not choose a background image, therefore, it is important to see or hide the limits of the view.

![display](../../screenshots/editor/initial/initial-space.jpg)

The width (X MAX) and height (Y MAX) take the width and height values defined by the image you loaded from the Display tab.

## change the viewing space with the new graduation

By default, the viewing space will correspond to the dimensions of the background image.


The viewing space can be adjusted with a new graduation as needed:

- By increasing / decreasing the space to the right
- By increasing / decreasing the space on the left side
- By increasing / decreasing space at top
- By increasing / decreasing space at the bottom

> For example:
> If the graduation is 10 in X, this means that it is possible to put 10 points in X (0 TO 10)
> If we do the same thing in Y, we will have 10 points in Y (0 TO 10)

It is possible to leave with negative values.
