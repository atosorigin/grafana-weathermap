# Oriented Link

[![](../../screenshots/other/Go-back.png)](coordinates.md)

Adding a new [oriented link](../panel/panel-oriented-link.md) or [curved link](../panel/panel-incurved-link.md) is done from the panel menu.

You can change the coordinates of an oriented link below :

## Required information

The mandatory information to display the points is :

![saisie oriented link](../../screenshots/editor/coordinates/screen-oriented-link/obligatoire.jpg)

### Label

This is a key to add the result of value to the parameters

### Orientation

2 orientations are possible:

- monodirectional
- bidirectional
- nodirectional

### Size

Allows you to choose the size of the link by typing a number (ex: 1 to 128)

## Associate Point/Region In

![associate in](../../screenshots/editor/coordinates/screen-oriented-link/in.jpg)

Allows you to define the starting object of your link.

To do this you can associate it with a point and/or a region.

If you do not associate it, you enter the coordinates (X and Y) of departure.

## Associate Point/Region Out

![associate out](../../screenshots/editor/coordinates/screen-oriented-link/out.jpg)

Allows you to define the destination of your link.

To do this you can associate it with a point and/or a region.

If you do not associate it, you enter the coordinates (X and Y) of arrival.

## Incurved

![incurved](../../screenshots/editor/coordinates/screen-oriented-link/incurved.jpg)

It is possible to add an extra point to make a curve.

To do this, you must say **yes** in the **incurved** field to add a new point C in position X and Y.
